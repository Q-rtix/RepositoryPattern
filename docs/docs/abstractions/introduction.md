Welcome to the documentation for Repository Pattern Abstractions, a versatile library designed to simplify the
implementation of generic repositories and unit of work patterns with Entity Framework Core. This documentation serves
as a comprehensive guide to understanding and using the features provided by the Repository Pattern Abstractions
library.

## What is Repository Pattern Abstractions?

Repository Pattern Abstractions is a versatile .NET library designed to streamline the implementation of the repository
pattern and unit of work pattern in applications utilizing the ORM of your choice. By furnishing generic interfaces for
repositories and unit of work, this library fosters the creation of cleaner, more maintainable data access code, while
also encouraging the separation of concerns within your application architecture.

## Key Features

- **Generic Repository Interface**: Define repository interfaces for different entity types using a single generic
  interface.
- **Flexible Unit of Work Interface**: Manage database transactions and coordinate repository operations through a
  flexible unit of work interface.
- **Dependency Injection Integration**: Seamlessly integrate the repository pattern services into your application using
  the built-in dependency injection container in ASP.NET Core.

## Getting Started

To start using Repository Pattern Abstractions in your project, follow these simple steps:

1. **Installation**: Install the Repository Pattern Abstractions package via NuGet package manager or .NET CLI.
2. **Creating DbContext**: Create your DbContext class inheriting from `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.DbContext`.
3. **Implementing Repositories**: Create repository implementations by implementing the `IRepository<TEntity>`
   interface.
4. **Implementing Unit of Work**: Implement the unit of work pattern by creating a class that implements
   the `IUnitOfWork` interface.
5. **Injecting Services**: Add the repository pattern services to your application's service collection using dependency
   injection.
