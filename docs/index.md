## About `RepositoryPattern.Abstractions`

`RepositoryPattern.Abstractions` is a library that create the repository pattern abstractions for the.NET ecosystem,
providing a structured approach to database access and management. By decoupling your application's data access logic
from the underlying data source, `RepositoryPattern.Abstractions` promotes modularity, testability, and maintainability.
With
this library, you can create and use repositories to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, manage
transactions, and execute custom queries, all while adhering to best practices in software architecture.

**Did you find a bug?**

- Ensure the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub
  under [Issues](https://github.com/Q-rtix/RepositoryPattern/issues).
- If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the
  problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/Q-rtix/RepositoryPattern/issues/new). Be sure to include a title and clear
  description, as much relevant information as possible, and a code sample or an executable test case demonstrating the
  expected behavior that is not occurring.

**Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

- Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.
- Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

**Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

- First suggest your change in the [RepositoryPattern ideas page](https://github.com/Q-rtix/RepositoryPattern/discussions/categories/ideas)
  for discussion.
- There are no fixed rules on what should and shouldn't be in this library, but some features are more valuable than
  others, and some require long-term maintenance that outweighs the value of the feature. So please get sign-off from
  the
  project leader (Carlos J. Ortiz) before putting in an excessive amount of work.

**Do you have questions about the source code?**

- Ask any question about how to use RepositoryPattern in
  the [RepositoryPattern discussion page](https://github.com/Q-rtix/RepositoryPattern/discussions/new?category=q-a).
